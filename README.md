# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Summary
My final project within Big Data Machine Learning course.
The goal was to predict the number of Seoul bikeshare bikes to be used based on the day of the year, hour of the day and weather conditions information.
Utilization of such a model could enable better bike sharing demand fulfillment, which leads to higher customer satisfaction and revenue increase, while creating cost-cutting opportunities.

I have performed explorational data analysis, initiated regression models, performed cross-validation, grid search for parameter tuning and assessed results.

## Dataset
Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
